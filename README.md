# Hype the Time Quest remake

This is a project to recreate the mechanics of hype the time quest with the possibility for the [Hype the Time Quest community over at discord]([https://discord.gg/PGqVJTP](https://discord.gg/PGqVJTP)) to help out with other details of the game. This project aims to initially be a faithful recreation of the original game that will let us more easily play it on modern hardware instead of having to jump through hoops or emulating it.

Down the line I personally would love to create an upgraded version with modernised graphics, modding support, level streaming and other features I think could be cool. But that is not in the initial scope of the project.
## I want to help, what can I contribute?

You can contribute in many ways, both through creative tasks and through gathering information about the game.
### Creative tasks
If you feel like learning or practising a creative task this is a great opportunity to do tasks that is low stakes without much pressure. 
- 3D Models for Areas, Characters, Enemies, Weapons, Items, Chests and more!
- Animations, Visual effects (for things like magic, time travel, explosions from barrels, water), Texturing, Creating Icons, Creating Menu art, Rigging Characters and Enemies
- Music, Sound effects, Voice Acting, Creating Animations like the intro and ending.
- Placing enemies and objects throughout the levels.

### I can't/don't want to do any of these! Is there any other way I can help?

That's completely fine, there's a lot of tasks that doesn't require you to know or even want to do any creative tasks that are also very important but require a lot of playing the game and writing things down to collect.
- Text from NPC dialogue
- Item restrictions, unlocks, prices, drop rates
- Quest rewards
- Information on how much mana, health and damage reduction Hype has as well as any enemy we can find.
- Locations of enemies, types, save points, chests, shops, NPC's and where they walk around.

I'm sure there's more that I'm missing but I'll add it if I think of anything. Hope you are able to help with anything and let's bring this project to life!
